# (1) Given an integer n, write a for loop that outputs the numbers from -n to +n. Assume n is nonnegative. End the sequence with a newline.
#
# Enter an integer:
# 2
# Sequence: -2 -1 0 1 2
# (2) If n is negative, treat as the absolute value. So n of -2 is the same as n of 2. Hint: Use an if statement before the for loop, to compute the absolute value of n.
#
# Enter an integer:
# -2
# Sequence: -2 -1 0 1 2

n = int(input())

print("Sequence: ", end="")
if n < 0:
    n = -n

for i in range(-n, n+1):
    print(i, end=" ")
