# Formatting makes text easier for the viewer to read. Given a 10-digit phone number, output the number in a format that is easier for a person to read.
#
# Ex: If the input is:
#
# 1234567890
# the output should be:
#
# (123) 456-7890

phone_number = input()

formatted_number = "(" + phone_number[0:3] + ") " + phone_number[3:6] + "-" + phone_number[6:10]
print(formatted_number)
