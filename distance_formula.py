# Map/GPS applications commonly compute the distance between two points.
# A point may be a coordinate on an x-y plane like (1.5, 2.0).
# The distance formula is d = âˆš((x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2)
# (basically, Pythagorean's Theorem). Given two points, output the distance between them.
# If the input is (1.5, 2.0) (4.5, 6.0), the output is 5.
