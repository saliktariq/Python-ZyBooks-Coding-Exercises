# Write an assignment statement for the following mathematical equation:
# y = (1/3)x + (x/4) + 2x
# Keep x as an integer.
# Use an expression that matches the equation's right side as closely as possible.
# If the input is -1, the output is -2.58333.

x = int(input())

y = ((1.0 / 3.0) * x) + (x / 4.0) + (2.0 * x)

print(y)
