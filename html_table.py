# HTML is the language of web pages. Items start and end with tags. A table starts with <table> and ends with </table>. In a table, a row starts with <tr> and ends with </tr>. In a row, a column starts with <td> and ends with </td>. Given two integers for rows and columns, generate an appropriately sized html table. Place the character c in each table cell. If the input is 2 3, the output is:
#
# <table>
# <tr> <td> c </td> <td> c </td> <td> c </td> </tr>
# <tr> <td> c </td> <td> c </td> <td> c </td> </tr>
# </table>

userRows = int(input())
userCols = int(input())

print("<table>")
for i in range(userRows):
    print("<tr> ", end="")
    for j in range(userCols):
        print("<td> c </td> ", end="")
    print("</tr>")
print("</table>")
